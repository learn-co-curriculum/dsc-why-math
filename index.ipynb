By training a model, you will learn about the concept of a **loss function**, and calculus can tells us where to move next to work towards minimizing this loss function.\n", "\n", "Many algorithms in machine learning have a loss function, such that as we change the parameters of a model, the cost associated with that model changes. Calculus can gives us an expectation as to how the cost associated with a model changes as we update that model. In general, calculus can tell us *the rate of change*, and if we know how our cost function is changing, we can use this knowledge about how our loss changes as we change a parameter, to tell us how to change a model parameter next.\n", "\n", "\n", "Don't worry if this all doesn't fully make sense yet.
