# Why Math?

Before moving on, let's take a step back. Once you'll start learning about algorithms in Data Science, you'll always follow a certain process:

* **Collect**: Gather and clean the relevant data
* **Explore**: Explore the data
* **Train**: Choose a statistical or machine learning model (ie. a tool or algorithm) and optimize the model for some criteria (eg. how well the model predicts our data)
* **Predict**: Make predictions with the trained model

For the **Collect** and **Explore** part of the process, you will mainly use your Python skills and knowledge about the domain. 

When you talk about **Training** a model is more about machine learning. 

## Training a model

This training step is where calculus comes in. By training a model, you will learn about the concept of a **loss function**, and calculus can tells us where to move next to work towards minimizing this loss function.

Many algorithms in machine learning have a loss function, such that as we change the parameters of a model, the cost associated with that model changes. Calculus can gives us an expectation as to how the cost associated with a model changes as we update that model. In general, calculus can tell us *the rate of change*, and if we know how our cost function is changing, we can use this knowledge about how our loss changes as we change a parameter, to tell us how to change a model parameter next.


Don't worry if this all doesn't fully make sense yet. In the bootcamp, you'll learn more about loss functions and and how to get to an optimal model. The goal of describing this process here is to explain to you _why_ math plays an important role in data science. In the next two lessons, we'll be brushing up your memory.

- In the next lesson, we'll be refreshing your knowledge on how to **express mathematical functions**. You'll use Python as well, and will see the overlap between Python functions and mathematical functions.

- In the lesson after that, you'll briefly touch upon **math notation** and where math notation comes in handy.


## Summary

In this lesson, we explained why math is important in data science. Let's dive into some more math in the next two lessons!
